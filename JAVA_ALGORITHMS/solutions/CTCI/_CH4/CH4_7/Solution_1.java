	/*
	 * Best Solution will be is to keep going to parent until you reach root for one node and for 
	 * every node set isVisited = true; Now from another Node keep going to parent until you see 
	 * node which has isVisited =true and you have find an ancestor.
	 * 
	 *  What if you cant access parent? Solution 2 is the best.

	/*
	 * Best solution is to update the find method and keep adding isVisited = true , when you are finding other node, 
	 * see the last isVisited = true before you find your node and that will be your ancestor.
	 * But NOTE: says that This is not necessarily BST, 
	 * 
	 * Since this is not BST, solution 2 is the best.
