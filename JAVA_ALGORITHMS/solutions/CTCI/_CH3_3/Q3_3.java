/*
 * Question : Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it migh t topple. 
 * Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. 
 * Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOf- Stacks should be composed of several stacks 
 * and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. 
 * SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks. pop () should behave identically to a single stack 
 * (that is, pop () should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).
 * 
 * FOLLOW UP
 * Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs apop operation ona specific sub-stack

//Answer:   Just look at the solution its very easy to implement
